               These boxes can make any workout more intense by involving more muscles into each rep!  Create challenges, and have fun! Jumping is the closest thing to flying so let’s get to it! Other than the turf area, our class room is also available for use when there are no classes in session. No sure what functional training entails or how to do it? Let us help and answer all your questions! Our trainers are available to show you what a functional workout should look like! It's included and you've got to try it.
